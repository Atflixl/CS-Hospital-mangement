Down Syndrome
Down Syndrome is a genetic disorder causing an increase in the chromosomes from 46 to 47, when there is abnormal cell division in the genetic material of the chromosome No. 21.


This genetic disorder, which varies in severity from a baby to another, causes a lifelong intellectual disability, developmental delays and difficulties in education among children with Down syndrome.

Early intervention can greatly increase the quality of life for children and adults with Down syndrome and help them coexist with the community.


Symptoms:
Intellectual difficulties among people with Down syndrome range from mild to moderate.
Children with Down syndrome have similar facial features, including:

Small head
Short neck
Flat back of head
Large and protruding tongue
Upward slant to the eyes
Small ears
Short hands
Palm contains only one or two lines
Relatively short fingers
Small white spots on the colored part (iris) of the eye called Brushfield spots
Short stature

Types & Causes:

Trisomy 21: In about 95% of Down syndrome cases, the child has three copies of chromosome 21 (instead of the usual two) in all cells as a result of an abnormal cell division during the development of the sperm or egg.
Mosaic Down syndrome: This form occurs when there is an additional copy of the chromosome 21 in children, as a result of abnormal division of cells after fertilization.
Translocation Down syndrome: In this form, the chromosome 21 breaks off and gets attached to another chromosome, before or at conception.
Is it inherited?
Scientific studies have proved that the Down syndrome is not inherited, and the main cause is an error in cell division of the egg or sperm or during formation of embryos.

Translocation Down syndrome is the only form which can be transmitted from a parent to a child, affecting about 4% of children with Down syndrome:
If father is the carrier, the risk is about 3 percent.
If mother is the carrier, the risk is between 10 and 15 percent.
Risk factors:
Some parents have a higher risk of having a baby with Down syndrome. This includes:
Advancing mother age: As the mother gets older, the probability of having a child with Down syndrome increases because older eggs have a greater risk of improper chromosome division.
The risks of Down syndrome depend on the age of the mother:

At age of 35, the risk of having a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 350.
At age of 40, the risk of having a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 100.
At age of 45, the risk of having a child with Down syndrome is 1 in 30.
After having a child with Down syndrome: A woman who has a child with Down syndrome is more likely to have another child with the same condition by 1 in 100.
Mother and father who carry the gene of Down syndrome resulted from translocation can pass the disorder to their child.
Complications:
Children with Down syndrome can have many complications; some of them become more prominent as they get older, such as:

Heart defects: About half of children with Down syndrome are born with different types of heart defects. Some of them may be life-threatening and may require surgery in early infancy.
Leukemia: Children with Down syndrome have an increased risk of leukemia.
Infectious diseases: Because of abnormalities in their immune systems, those with Down syndrome are much more at risk of infectious diseases, such as pneumonia.
Dementia: Those infected with Down syndrome have a greatly increased risk of dementia and symptoms and signs may begin around age 50. This also increases the risks of convulsions and Alzheimer's disease.
Sleep apnea: Due to changes in tissues and bones, the airway is obstructed. Children and adults with Down syndrome are more susceptible to the risk of sleep apnea.
Obesity: People with Down syndrome have a greater tendency to be obese compared with those in the same age.
Other health problems: Down syndrome is associated with other health problems, including intestinal obstruction, thyroid problems, early menopause, convulsions, ear infections, hearing loss, poor eyesight, and skin problems such as psoriasis.

Life expectancy:
In 1910, children with Down syndrome often did not live to age 10.
But today, they may live up to age of 60 and beyond, depending on the severity of their health problems.

Diagnosis:
Tests during Pregnancy:
Screening test: To detect the likelihood a mother is carrying a baby with Down syndrome.
Diagnosis test: To identify whether your baby has Down syndrome.


First trimester screening:
Blood test: This blood test measures the levels of pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A) and the pregnancy hormone (HCG). Abnormal levels of these proteins may indicate a problem with the baby.
Ultrasound: It is used to measure a specific area on the back of your baby, to detect any abnormalities.
Based on the results of blood test and ultrasound, in addition to the mother's age, the doctor can    estimate the risk of having a baby with Down syndrome.



Integrated screening test:
It is done on two phases: the first in the first trimester, the second in the second trimester of the pregnancy.
The first trimester: Part one includes a blood test to measure PAPP-A and ultrasound.
The second trimester: It measures 4 substances in the blood namely, alpha fetoprotein, estriol, a pregnancy hormone (HCG), and inhibin A.
Cell-free fetal DNA analysis: Usually this test is recommended for women with high risk of giving birth to a child infected with Down syndrome, and the mother's blood can be tested after 10 weeks gestation.
This test is considered more specific than other screening methods for Down syndrome.
Diagnostic tests during pregnancy:
Amniocentesis: A sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is withdrawn through a needle into the mother's uterus. This sample is used to analyze the chromosomes of the fetus. Preferably be done in the second trimester, after 15 weeks of pregnancy.
Chorionic villus sampling (CVS): Cells are taken from the placenta and used to analyze the fetal chromosomes.
Cordocentesis: In this test umbilical blood sampling is taken to examine the chromosomes. This test can be performed between 18 and 22 weeks of pregnancy. This test carries a significantly greater risk of miscarriage, so it is only offered when results of other tests are unclear and the desired information can't be obtained any other way.
Diagnostic tests for newborns: After birth, the initial diagnosis of Down syndrome is often based on the baby's appearance. But the features associated with Down syndrome (the face and body) can be found in babies without Down syndrome, so you doctor will likely order a test to analyze the baby's chromosomes, if there is an extra chromosome in the chromosome 21.

Treatment:
Early intervention programs: Programs vary, but they usually involve therapists and special educators for this category, designed to help the baby develop motor skills, language, social skills and self-help skills.

Team care: There should be a medical team care for the child with Down syndrome. The team may include some of these experts:
Primary care pediatrician.
Pediatric gastroenterologist.
Pediatric endocrinologist.
Pediatric neurologist.
Pediatric ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.
Pediatric eye doctor (ophthalmologist).
Audiologist.
Physical therapist.
Specialist, special education for Down syndrome category.

Prevention:
There is no way to prevent giving birth to a baby with Down syndrome. If the parents or one of them carrying the translocation type of Down syndrome, or the family already have one child with Down syndrome, you must consult a genetic counselor before becoming pregnant.

Blood


What is blood?
Blood is a vital fluid that flows through the blood vessels, reaching all organs of the body.

What are the basic components of blood?
Plasma makes up 55%-60% of the blood volume, and is a yellow fluid that contains water, salts, proteins, hormones, and antibodies. It acts as a carrier of nutrients and gases and contributes to regulating blood pressure and providing immunity.
Red blood cells make up about 40% of the blood volume and contain hemoglobin that facilitates the exchange of gases between cells and the lungs.
White blood cells make up a small part of the blood, and are an essential part of the immune system, and help fight infection and inflammation.
Platelets play an important role in the clotting process, as they gather in affected areas to form a blood clot and prevent bleeding.

What is plasma?
Plasma is the liquid component of blood and makes up about 55%-60% of the total blood volume. It is a yellow fluid that contains:
Water, salts, and proteins (such as albumin).
Hormones.
Antibodies.
Coagulation factors.
Vitamins.

What are the main functions of plasma?
Transport of nutrients: Plasma provides nutrients, minerals and vitamins to cells and muscles.
Gas exchange: It contributes to the primary exchange of gases at the cellular level.
Blood pressure regulation: Albumin contributes to the regulation of osmotic blood pressure levels.
Transport of molecules: It helps in transporting minerals, salts and medications throughout the body.
Immunity: It contains antibodies that form one of the body's main lines of defense.
Protection against bleeding: It contains clotting factors that protect against bleeding.

What diseases are treated by plasma-derived drugs?
Immune diseases: These include autoimmune diseases, rheumatism and some neurological diseases, where immune antibodies are used.
Fluid loss: Human albumin is used to treat cases of acute fluid loss such as severe burns.
Bleeding: Clotting factors are used to treat patients with bleeding.
The primary source of these medicines is plasma collected from donors, which undergoes separation and testing.

What are the steps followed in the plasma donation process to ensure the safety of the donor and patients?
Plasma donation is a process performed by individuals who are medically fit for this process. Plasma is collected from donors in designated blood donation centers, where medical examinations are conducted to verify the health of the donor, and to ensure that he is free of blood diseases or any health condition that may endanger the lives of patients.

How to benefit from plasma?
After collecting the plasma, it is frozen to maintain its quality and effectiveness. It is stored at a low temperature in blood bank warehouses until it is examined and reprocessed to extract various derivatives from the plasma.

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection

Overview:

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives and multiplies in the lining of the stomach.
Helicobacter pylori is a common cause of many stomach diseases including peptic ulcers.
H. pylori bacteria may be passed from person to person through contaminated food or water, or through sharing eating utensils with an infected person.
The main symptoms are: Pain and swelling in the abdomen, and loss of appetite.
The best way to prevent an H. pylori infection is by avoiding contaminated food or water, and not sharing utensils with others.


Definition of H. pylori infection:

Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is a spiral shaped bacterium that lives and multiplies in the lining of the stomach, and it is a common cause of many stomach diseases including peptic ulcers. Once infected, a person usually stays infected for life unless they are treated with specific antibiotics.

Dry Cough

What is a dry cough:

A dry cough is one that is not associated with a phlegm in the throat. Sometimes a dry cough is accompanied by a feeling of swelling and congestion or a tickling in the throat, and one begins to try to cough to get rid of it, but to no avail.



Causes:

A person may develop a dry cough without any other accompanying symptoms, or become infected as they suffer from influenza or colds. Coughing may persist even after recovery from these diseases.

Having a throat infection
Inhalation of a cough-causing substance such as dust or smoke.
Asthma.
Nose or chest allergy.


There are other less common causes, including:

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
GERD.
Heart disease (in rare cases).
Whooping cough (pertussis).
Pneumonia


Types of dry cough:

Dry cough has three types, namely:

Dry Cough: Associated with a viral infection in the nose or throat, and the patient usually feels that something is stuck in his throat.
Croup: Associated with  swelling or infection in the larynx In this case,  the patient feels pain in the throat when coughing and difficulty breathing.
Whooping cough: Associated with the presence of bacteria In this case, the patient coughs continuously and this is followed by whooping.


Consult your doctor immediately if:

The person with dry cough is less than 5 years old.
The  dry cough contains mucus or blood.
dry cough is associated with shortness of breath.
The frequency of dry cough increases especially at night.
Smoking.
if fever is accompanied by: Constant headache or a rash or inflammation of the ear.
In case of significant weight loss with muscle pain.
If a person with a dry cough has high blood pressure or has heart disease, asthma, or stomach problems.
If a woman with a cough is pregnant or breastfeeding, some medications can affect her or her baby's health.
If the patient develops an allergy to some medications they are taking for the cough


Treatment:

Dry cough can be treated by:

nebulizer sessions The patient inhales hot steam that reduces the severity of the cough. It can be received by your doctor or hospital, and pharmacies have nebulizers that are suitable for home use.



Some home remedies that have soothing properties for dry cough:

Honey: One of the oldest treatments for dry cough, and usually an ingredient in all cough medications because of its known effect in soothing the throat.
Curcuma.
Ginger.
Garlic.
Guava leaves.
Salt water gargle

Schizophrenia

Overview:

Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder that affects the way a patient: thinks, acts, expresses emotions, perceives reality and relates to others.
Contrary to popular belief, schizophrenia is not a split or multiple personality.  It is a type of mental illness in which a person can't tell what's real from what's imagined.
Schizophrenia is a chronic that requires lifelong treatment.


Causes:

The exact cause of schizophrenia is still unknown, but researchers believe that a combination of genetics, brain chemistry and environment contributes to development of the disorder. Problems with certain naturally occurring brain chemicals, including neurotransmitters like dopamine may contribute to schizophrenia.



Symptoms:

In men, schizophrenia symptoms typically start in the early to mid-20s. In women, symptoms typically begin in the late 20s. It's uncommon for children to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and rare for those older than age 45.

Schizophrenia involves a range of problems with thinking (cognition), behavior or emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually they reflect an impaired ability to function. Symptoms may include:

Delusions: These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. These beliefs are firmly-held by the patient despite clear and obvious evidence that they are not true. For example, schizophrenics may believe that they are being harmed or harassed; or that they have exceptional abilities and talents; or that their actions are being controlled by outside forces; or that their bodies are not functioning properly. 4 out of every 5 schizophrenia patients suffer from delusions.
Hallucinations: These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
Disorganized thinking: This can be inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be illogical or completely unrelated.
Disorganized or abnormal motor behavior: This may show in a number of ways, such as useless and excessive movements or behaving in a childlike unpredictable manner.


Risk factors of Schizophrenia:

Although the exact cause of schizophrenia isn't known, certain factors seem to increase the risk of developing or triggering schizophrenia, including:

Having a family history of schizophrenia.
Certain viral infections.
Malnutrition during pregnancy, especially in the first and second trimesters.
Increased immune system activation, such as from autoimmune diseases
Taking mind-altering and hallucinogenic drugs.


Complications:

Left untreated, schizophrenia can result in serious psychological, behavioral and health issues, such as:

Suicide.
Self-harm.
Anxiety and terror.
Depression.
Alcohol and drug abuse.
Homelessness.
Family disputes.
Inability to work or study.
Social isolation.


Diagnosis:

To diagnose schizophrenia, the doctor examines the patient's genetic and medical history and asks questions about the patient's symptoms and family history. Blood tests and brain scans are also done to help rule out other conditions with similar symptoms.



Treatment:

Schizophrenia requires lifelong treatment, even when symptoms have subsided.

Treatment is divided into:

Treatment with medications
and psychosocial therapy.
In some severe cases, hospitalization may be needed to ensure the patient's safety, proper nutrition, adequate sleep and basic hygiene.

Meningitis (spinal fever)

Overview:

Inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord, and can infect anyone.
Most Meningitis types transmitted by respiratory secretions.
Early symptoms are flu-like, and intensify within a short period.
There is no specific treatment for viruses, and treatment aims at strengthening the body with fluids.
Taking the vaccine is one of the most important ways to prevent the disease.


Definition:

Spinal fever is an inflammation of the protective membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord (meninges), where swelling caused by inflammation leads to symptoms such as headache, fever and stiff neck. It can affect anyone, but it is most common among young people from birth to adulthood, as well as the elderly .



Types of Meningitis :

Bacterial Meningitis : The types of bacteria that affect people vary in every age group, and are infectious, dangerous and life-threatening.
Viral Meningitis : More common than bacteria, and are most commonly spread in late summer and early autumn. They are infectious and usually mild and quick to heal.
Chronic Meningitis : Spreads among people if its bacterial
Other types Fungal Meningitis, parasitic Meningitis , chemical Meningitis
Other Names:
Spinal fever, Meningitis.



Causes:
Transmission of bacteria (meningococcal bacteria, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenzae B), viruses (enterovirus, mumps virus, or herpes simplex virus) to the body.



Modes of Transmission:
Most Meningitis types transmitted by respiratory secretions in the following ways:

Sneezing.
Cough.
Kissing.
Sharing cups, toothbrushes, cigarettes and other items.
Bacterial Meningitis : It is often transmitted from people carrying bacteria in the throat or nose, and is rarely transmitted from infected people.
Fungal Meningitis : Infection is acquired from the environment (e.g: Inhaling the pathogen from a place contaminated with remnants of birds, bats, etc.) and is not transmitted among people.
Parasitic Meningitis : Infection is acquired from the environment (e.g: Rodents such as mice and raccoons).



Risk factors:

Not taking the vaccine.
Age: Most cases of viral infection affect children under the age of 5 years, while bacterial infection is common at the age of 20 years and less.
Pregnancy.
Weak  body immunity due to AIDS or diabetes, splenectomy and others.
Living in a large group of people (such as: Collective housing or military bases) because the prevalence of infection increases in crowds.
Traveling to epidemic areas such as the African meningitis belt countries.
Contact with people with infectious types of this disease.
Going for Hajj and Umrah and contact with pilgrims who may be infected or carriers of the disease.


Symptoms:
Initially, flu-like symptoms appear, worsening within several hours or days.
Symptoms in people over 2 years of age:

Sudden fever
Neck stiffness
Severe headache with nausea and vomiting
skin rashes.
Convulsions.
Difficulty concentrating.
Fatigue and difficulty waking up.
Sensitivity to light
Symptoms in babies less than two years of age:

Fever
Laziness and non responsiveness
Swelling of the fontanel area.
Stiffening of the child's body and neck.
Rejecting feeding.
Tantrums, rejecting being carried by others.
Unusual tone when crying
Convulsions.
Skin rash in some types of spinal fever
Bacterial meningitis is an emergency that requires immediate medical attention.



When to see a doctor?
See your doctor immediately if you notice symptoms of spinal fever on the same person, family member or even coworkers. You may need to take a vaccine to prevent infection.



Complications:
If meningitis is not treated promptly, it can cause serious toxemia, resulting in permanent damage to the brain and nerves.

Death.
Hearing loss.
Difficulty remembering and concentrating.
Learning difficulties.
Problems in walking and balance
Epilepsy seizures
Kidney problems


Diagnosis:

Medical history.
Clinical examination.
Laboratory tests: Blood culture, examination of cerebrospinal fluid (lumbar puncture).
CT scans.


Treatment:
It is important to know the type of cause of meningitis because the treatment varies depending on the cause:

Treatment of viral meningitis: It can not be treated with antibiotics, but in most cases it goes away without medical interventions by resting, drinking fluids and using painkillers.Your doctor may prescribe NSAIDs to relieve swelling of brain membranes, as well as prescribe antiepileptic drugs to control convulsions.
Treatment of bacterial meningitis: Intravenous antibiotics and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Medications vary depending on the bacteria causing the disease.
Your doctor may aspire fluids, and other treatments may include:

IV fluids  to avoid dehydration.
Antivirals may be used (but their treatment depends on body resistance) and antifungals depending on the cause.


Prevention:

Taking the vaccine for bacterial spinal fever.
Washing hands thoroughly.
Maintaining hygiene and not sharing cups, toothbrushes and others.
Improving the body's immunity by practicing healthy behaviors such as healthy food and exercising.
Covering the mouth and nose when sneezing
Dispensing  prophylactic treatment to those coming from infected areas or in contact with the infected.


Frequently Asked Questions:

Does meningitis vaccine hurt in the first weeks of pregnancy?
The Ministry of Health recommends that the vaccine be given to pregnant women when going to endemic areas, Hajj or Umrah.

Is there a relationship between smoking and meningitis?
There is no direct relationship between them, but smoking affects the lungs and Pneumonia can develop into spinal fever.
Is spinal fever transmitted by shaking hands with the infected person?
Infection can be transmitted if the hand is contaminated with the patient's spray


Misconceptions:

Viral spinal fever is a simple type of disease.
Fact: Although not life-threatening, they can cause permanent damage such as headaches and memory loss.

Spinal fever cannot be cured.
Fact: There is no specific treatment for viruses, and treatment aims at strengthening the body with fluids.
Spinal fever affects newborns only .
Fact: No, it could infect anyone.
Children who had spinal fever are not advised to take the vaccine.
Fact: wrong, for many reasons:
1. There are many types and causes of meningitis, there are multiple vaccines as well (including three types in the vaccination schedule in the Kingdom). Having one type does not prevent infection of the other type.
2. The same type of infection can occur again as there is no natural immunity (i.e, the natural immunity produced after the disease does not last a lifetime, as it disappears within a few years).

Spina Bifida

Overview:

Spina bifida is a birth defect that falls under the category of neural tube defects. This defect can occur anywhere on the spine.
Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, and it may lead to minor physical disabilities or non at all.
The exact cause of spina bifida is still unknown, but it could be attributed to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.
Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity, and they can be different for each person.
Taking enough folic acid supplements before and during pregnancy is the best way to prevent spina bifida.


Definition:

Spina bifida is a birth defect that falls under the category of neural tube defects. The neural tube is the embryonic structure that eventually develops into the baby's brain and spinal cord and the tissues that enclose them. This defect can occur anywhere on the spine and it may result in cognitive and physical disabilities. Spina bifida can range from mild to severe, depending on:

The size and location of the neural tube defect.
Whether skin covers the affected area.
Which spinal nerves come out of the affected area of the spinal cord.


Types of spina bifida:

Spina bifida occulta: ("Occulta" means hidden)
It is the mildest form of spina bifida, and it results in a small gap in one or more of the spine vertebrae. In this form of spina bifida there is no opening or sac on the infant's back and the spinal nerves are usually normal. Because the spinal nerves usually aren't involved, infants with spina bifida occulta don't show any signs or symptoms that indicate any neurological problems. Many people who have spina bifida occulta don't even know it, unless the condition is discovered during an imaging test done for unrelated reasons. This condition doesn't typically cause any disabilities.

Meningocele:
A rare form of spina bifida, where there is a sac protruding from the infant's back through an opening in the vertebrae. The sac is filled with fluid, but it doesn't contain the spinal cord, so nerve damage is less likely. This condition may result in minor disabilities.

Myelomeningocele:
Myelomeningocele is the most severe form of spina bifida in which the spine and spinal canal do not close before birth and the spinal canal is open along several back vertebrae. The membranes and spinal nerves push through this opening at birth, forming a sac on the baby's back, typically exposing tissues and nerves. This makes the baby prone to life-threatening infections. In certain cases, the sac may be covered by skin. This form of spina bifida results in moderate to severe disabilities (such as: loss of sensation in the legs or feet).



Causes:

Normally, the neural tube forms early in pregnancy, and it closes by the fourth week of pregnancy. In babies with spina bifida, a portion of the neural tube fails to develop or close properly, causing defects in the spinal cord and in the bones of the spine. The exact cause of this condition is not yet known, but as with many other health issues, it may be attributed to genetic and environmental factors.



Risk factors:

Although doctors and researchers don't know for sure why spina bifida occurs, they have identified some risk factors:

Family history.
Gender: Spina bifida is more common among females.
Having neural tube defects.
Folic acid deficiency during pregnancy.
Taking certain medications during pregnancy (such as: anti-seizure medications).
Females who are obese.
Females with diabetes.
Exposure to radiation.
Increased body temperature in the early weeks of pregnancy due to the use of saunas.


Symptoms:
Signs and symptoms of spina bifida vary by type and severity.
Spina bifida occulta: Typically there are no signs or symptoms, but visible indications can sometimes be seen on the newborn's skin above the spinal defect, including:

An abnormal tuft of hair, or a small dimple on the infant's back.
A small birthmark.
Myelomeningocele symptoms:

The spinal canal remains open along several back vertebrae.
The spinal cord or nerves protrude forming a sac.


When to see a doctor:
Typically, spina bifida is diagnosed before or right after birth, and these patients should receive regular medical care throughout their lives.

Complications:

Bowel and bladder problems.
Urinary tract infections.
Total or partial paralysis of the legs.
Orthopedic complications (foot deformities, and asymmetric hips).
Scoliosis (a sideways curvature of the spine).
Hydrocephalus (accumulation of fluid in the brain).
Meningitis (infection in the tissues surrounding the brain).
Learning difficulties, and speech disorders.
Dairy allergy or latex allergy.
Depression.


Diagnosis:

In certain cases, the condition is not detected until after the infant is born. However, most cases of spina bifida are diagnosed before birth with the help of the following diagnostic measures:

Laboratory tests: Maternal serum alpha-fetoprotein (MSAFP) test. For the MSAFP test, a sample of the mother's blood is drawn and tested for alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), which is a protein produced by the fetus. This test measures the amount of AFP that crossed the placenta and entered the mother's bloodstream. Abnormally high levels of AFP suggest that the baby has a neural tube defect, such as spina bifida.
Amniocentesis: For this test a small sample of the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus is taken.  Higher than average levels of AFP in the fluid may indicate spina bifida.
Ultrasound: Ultrasounds are routinely performed between 16-18 weeks of pregnancy.
Additional tests: An ultrasound scan of the kidneys and bladder.


Treatment:

Neurological damage is often irreversible, which means that spina bifida treatment is mostly aimed at preventing complications. Treatment options depend on the severity of the condition, for instance, spina bifida occulta often doesn't require treatment at all, but other types of spina bifida do. This includes:

Surgery: Treating meningocele requires surgical intervention to put the protective membranes around the spinal cord (meninges) back in place and close the opening in the vertebrae. Myelomeningocele also requires surgery. Performing the surgery early (24 to 48 hours after birth) can help minimize risk of infection that's associated with the exposed nerves and may also help protect the spinal cord from more trauma. Sometimes a shunt to control hydrocephalus in the baby's brain is placed during the operation on the spinal cord.
Rehabilitative therapy: This includes physiotherapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy, and this may require assistive equipment (such as: walking aids and wheelchairs).
Treatment for bladder and bowel problems typically begins soon after birth.

Prevention:

Folic acid supplements must be taken starting at least one month before conception and continuing through the first trimester of pregnancy. Sometimes, higher doses of folic acid may be needed; such as in the following cases:
If any of the risk factors are present.
If you have spina bifida or if you've given birth to a child with spina bifida.
If you're taking anti-seizure medications.
If you have diabetes.
It's also important to check with your doctor before taking dietary supplements with high doses of folic acid.

Polio

Key Facts:

Poliomyelitis mainly affects children under the age of five, but it may also affect adults and those who have not completed their vaccination or are immunocompromised.
In most cases, polio is asymptomatic and spreads rapidly.
One in 200 cases develops into irreversible paralysis (usually of the legs). Among those paralyzed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing muscles become immobilized.
Polio cases have decreased by over 99% since 1988, from an estimated 350 000 cases then, to 1604 reported cases in 2009. This comes as a the result of global efforts to eliminate the disease.
Down from more than 125 in 1988, polio was endemic in only four countries around the world in 2010. The four countries where polio is still endemic are: Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan.
The Polio Eradication Initiative is currently focusing on pockets of transmission that remain persistent in northern India and northern Nigeria and on the border between Afghanistan and Pakistan.
As long as a single child remains infected, children in all countries are at risk of contracting polio. Between 2009 and 2010, 23 previously polio-free countries were re-infected due to imports of the virus.
In most countries, the global effort has expanded capacities to tackle other infectious diseases by building effective surveillance and immunization systems. Active research within these efforts has enriched the knowledge about the virus causing the disease.
The success of eradication efforts depends on the possibility of bridging a large fiscal deficit to finance the next steps of the Global Eradication Initiative.


What is Polio?

It is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus that invades the nervous system. The virus sometimes enters the human body (child or adult) through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. It causes paralysis and can sometimes lead to death due to the paralysis of the muscles responsible for breathing. The virus used to kill many of those who contract it before the vaccine.



Symptoms:

90% of people infected with the virus do not show any symptoms.
4% to 8% of people with Polio have flu-like symptoms such as fever, fatigue, nausea, headache, stiffness in the neck and back and pain in the extremities.
1% permanent paralysis of extremities.
5% to 10% of cases die due to paralysis of respiratory muscles.


Complications:
Paralysis that may lead to permanent disability and death.

Infection:
It is transmitted from infected to healthy people through direct contact.

Treatment and Prevention:
Polio is an incurable disease that can only be prevented. Physical therapy with antispasmodic drugs helps relax muscles.
Given multiple times, the vaccine protects a child for life.



Polio Vaccine:
There are two types of polio vaccine:

Inactivated Polio Vaccine - IPV
Oral Polio Vaccine - OPV


Who should be vaccinated? Should children and infants be vaccinated?

Children should receive doses of IPV at the following ages:

One dose at the age of two months.
One dose at the age of 4 months.
One dose at the age of 6-8 months.
Booster dose at the age of 4-6 years.


Do adults need to be vaccinated?
Adults do not need the vaccine at this age as they have received it before at a younger age, except for three specific groups:

People traveling to areas where the disease is endemic.
Workers in polio-concerned laboratories.
Health workers who have direct contact with patients.
These groups should take the vaccine in 3 doses:

First dose: Anytime.
Second dose: One or two months after the first dose.
Third dose: 6-12 months after the second dose.

Chickenpox

Overview:

Chickenpox is a fast-spreading viral infection that causes acute fever and a skin rash.
It usually appears on the face, chest and back and then spreads to the rest of the body.
The best way to prevent it is by taking a vaccine, which is safe and effective.
A person becomes infected and is contagious before the rash appears and for a week after the rash disappearance.
If a person develops Chickenpox, they become immune to the virus for life.


Introduction:

Chicken pox is a viral infection transmitted via the respiratory tract, causing itching and a rash with small blisters filled with fluids It is easily transmitted from one person to the other, usually lasting about five to ten days.



Cause:

Infection is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is transmitted either by breathing the spray of the infected person in the air after coughing or sneezing, or by contact with the rash only and not contact with the patient.



Chickenpox and Shingles:

If a person has chickenpox, they can be susceptible to Shingles which is caused by the same virus.

After the patient recovers from chickenpox, the virus is stored in neurons, can reactivate and reappear after several years in the form of Shingles.



Symptoms:

The main symptom of chickenpox is a red rash consisting of patches or blisters, which may first appear on the face and chest, and then spread to the rest of the body including inside the mouth, eyelids, or genital area.

some signs might appear before the skin rash, including:

A fever of 38° C or more
Headache.
General exhaustion
Muscle pains
Loss of appetite


When to see a doctor:

when the rash spreads to one or both eyes
When a swelling, redness or heat is felt in the rash, indicating a possible secondary bacterial infection.
Appearance of other symptoms with the rash, such as: Dizziness, confusion, rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, difficulty walking, severe cough, vomiting, stiff neck or fever higher than 38.9° C.


Diagnosis:

Clinical examination.
Lab tests.


Incubation Period:

It usually takes one to three weeks for symptoms to appear after infection.



Risk factors:

Not getting the virus before.
Not taking chickenpox vaccine.
Immunosuppressive drugs.
Diseases that weaken immunity, such as cancer and others.


Most vulnerable groups:

Newborns
Pregnant women
The elderly


Complications:

Bacterial infections of the skin, bones, joints or bloodstream.
Septicemia (sepsis).
Dryness.
Pneumonia
Encephalitis


Treatment:

There is no final treatment, but your doctor may prescribe antipruritic and pain relievers that help relieve symptoms while the body fights infection.



Prevention:

The chickenpox vaccine is the best way to prevent chickenpox. It is highly effective and safe. Most people who get vaccinated will not get chickenpox, and if they do the vaccine significantly lessens the severity of chickenpox and only a few red spots and blisters may appear with a mild fever or even no fever at all.



Frequently Asked Questions:

When is Chickenpox contagious?
It is contagious in the incubation period (i.e. before the rash appears and blisters form) and for a week after the rash has passed.

Can I catch the smallpox virus again if I get it earlier?
Getting Chickenpox once means you won't get it again. This is called lifelong immunity; but in rare cases a person may get it again.



Misconceptions:

I can use Aspirin when getting chickenpox
Do not use aspirin or aspirin-containing products. The use of aspirin in children with chickenpox has been associated with Reye's syndrome, a severe disease that affects the liver and brain and can cause death.

Tinea Capitis

What is tinea capitis?

Tinea capitis is caused by a fungal infection of the scalp and hair root, resulting in itching, scaling, and hair loss. The fungus is very contagious and spreads among young school-age children. Treatment includes oral antifungals to eliminate the fungus with a special shampoo to wash the hair in order to prevent transmission. In rare cases, it can cause severe inflammation and permanent scarring and local baldness.



Symptoms:

One or several circular spots in which the skin becomes scaly and sensitive.
Scaled skin becomes red or gray.
Hair becomes brittle, weak and easily pulled out.
Sensitive or painful areas on the scalp.
Same signs can appear in other diseases. Therefore, careful diagnosis and confirmation of tinea capitis is needed.



Causes and Risk Factors:
Infection is caused by a fungus called dermatophyte, which attacks the outer skin layer and hairline. This fungus is very contagious and can spread in any of the following ways:

From person to another: Touching a person carrying the fungus, even for a short time, may help transmit the fungus and infection.
From animals: Animals can carry the fungus and transmit it to humans through direct or indirect contact. The fungus spreads among cats, dogs and field animals, especially puppies.
Personal tools: The fungus can transmit without direct contact with another person by moving to and staying on surfaces or objects that were touched by infected people or animal. The fungus can, therefore, transmit through towels, clothing, bed linens, combs and hairbrushes.
The disease is common among nursery- and school-age children, where transmission is easy due to physical contact between children and use of shared personal tools. There is a high risk of developing tinea capitis in children who have pets, because animals can carry fungi in their bodies without being infected. Poor hygiene and crowded living conditions increase the risk. Even though it is more common in children, it is important to remember that this condition can also occur in adults.



Complications:
In certain cases, the fungus causes an inflammatory reaction in the scalp called a kerion. In this case, yellow bags with purulent fluid drain cause a yellowish rash on the scalp. Heavy hair loss occurs in the inflamed area and the hair becomes easily pulled out. This is caused by an inflammatory reaction that can lead to scars on the scalp and permanent baldness.



Diagnosis:
Tinea is usually diagnosed by examining the characteristic appearance of the affected area on the scalp. In cases where the diagnosis is not conclusive, a careful microscopic examination can be performed on skin smear samples from the scalp.



Treatment:
Drugs used in the treatment of tinea capitis are:

Griseofulvin: This drug is available in form of syrup and tablets and is effective in eliminating the fungus. Skin allergies are common side effects, so caution should be taken to protect the skin from sun with long clothes and radiation filter.
Lamisil: Also known as terbinafine hydrochloride, this drug is also effective. It has some side effects, such as: abdominal pain, diarrhea, rashes and taste changes.
Treatment should be followed for the whole course as prescribed, even if skin signs resolve early.
In addition to drug therapy, it is recommended to use a therapeutic soap (shampoo) to wash the head three times a week. The shampoo contains selenium sulfide, which helps eliminating the fungus spores and thus preventing transmission to others. After applying the shampoo to the head, it should be kept for at least five minutes in order to effectively kill the fungi.



Prevention:
It is difficult to prevent tinea capitis because of its high contagiosity and easy transmission to humans, but maintaining personal hygiene, washing the head regularly and refraining from using shared tools such as towels and combs as well as refraining from touching infected animals, may reduce the risk.

 Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)

Overview:

It occurs due to the reflux of stomach acid to the esophagus causing a burning pain behind the chest bone
Making some lifestyle changes helps ease the symptoms
Antacids are effectives but the recurring burning sensation requires medical care
Maintaining a healthy lifestyle and healthy weight are key prevention methods
It is important to treat persistent heartburn as it harms the esophagus with time.


Definition:

Gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, is a digestive disorder that affects the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), the ring of muscle between the esophagus and stomach. Many people, including pregnant women, suffer from heartburn or acid indigestion caused by GERD



Other names:

Gastroesophageal reflux disease, GERD, heartburn



Cause:

In the normal digestion process, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food to pass into the stomach and closes to prevent food and acidic stomach juices from flowing back into the esophagus. Gastroesophageal reflux occurs when the LES is weak or relaxes inappropriately, allowing the stomach's contents to flow up into the esophagus.



Risk factors:

Obesity
Smoking
Pregnancy
Hiatal Hernia
Medications that weaken the function of the Sphincter


Symptoms

Pain and burning in the chest that could reach the throat and cause larynx infection and congestion
Pain and difficulty when swallowing
An acidic taste in the mouth, gingivitis, bad mouth smell
Dry cough
Hiccups
burping
increased saliva
Symptoms may worsen when bending or laying down or after excessive eating.



Reflux triggers:

anxiety and stress
eating large meals
eating spicy food
eating acidic products
eating tomato products like ketchup and sauce
eating fatty and fried food
eating chocolates
eating onions
caffeinated drinks such as gaseous drinks, coffee, etc.
mint


when to see a doctor?

when the burning sensation occurs for two or more days in a week
when there is difficulty in swallowing food or fluids
persistent nausea or vomiting
weight loss due to the loss of appetite
when symptoms persist despite taking medications


Complications

Esophagitis
Digestive ulcers
Barrett's syndrome abnormal cells form and take the place of the cells damaged by acid reflux.
Narrowing of the Esophagus


Diagnosis:

X-ray with barium
Esophagoscope
Testing acidity concentration


Treatment:

Simple antacids
H2 blockers.
Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)


Prevention:

Avoid foods and drinks that trigger the burn
Quit smoking
Maintain normal weight


Tips to ease the symptoms:

Make some changes in your lifestyle, such as:

Refraining from laying down immediately after eating
Eat 2-3 hours before going to bed
Divide meals into small spaced meals throughout the day
Avoid wearing tight clothes
Raise the head area in the bed by 15 – 20 cm


FAQs:

When is GERD considered a medical condition?
When reflux and burn is experienced for two days or more per week, or severely for more than one day a week

Does drinking milk treat GERD?
Drinking milk may ease the burn in the beginning but the effect is temporary and later leads to stimulating the production of stomach acids, especially if the milk is full fat.
Does eating cucumbers ease the burn?
There is no scientific evidence, but cucumber is not an irritant and this is subject to individual experience – some patients find it helpful and others find it useless
Does wearing corsets cause acid reflux and heartburn?
Yes – for those who are susceptible or have more than one risk factor



Misconceptions:

Reflux in pregnant women is the result of the baby's hair growth:
Fact: GERD in pregnant women is caused by several factors, including:
Increase in pregnancy hormone which relaxes the stomach muscle
The growth of the womb pressures the stomach and causes the burn. The baby's hair has nothing to do with it
Smoking relieves stomach acidity
Fact: smoking is one of the key causes of stomach and Esophagus diseases and doesn't ease the burn. Also, nicotine causes relaxation of the stomach muscle
It doesn't hurt to keep taking antacids without medical prescription
It is not advisable to take antacids for more than two weeks without medical assessment to find out the cause, if any, and treat it.
